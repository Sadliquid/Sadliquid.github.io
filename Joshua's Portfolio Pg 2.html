        I participated in the Singapore Games Creation Competition in 2019 and supported our other team in the Semi-Finals.<br>
        We used Construct-3 to design our game and this gave me insight on how I can utilise my skills in IT in the real world.<br>
        Although we didn't make it into the finals, it was a valuble experience to be able to compete against like-minded individuals and have fun at the same time.<br>

        I helped my team design the robot submission for the National Robotics Competition in 2019.<br>
        Our task was to design a robot to pick up of various colored bricks and place them onto specific places on the playmat.<br>
        We didn't make it to the runner-ups either, but it sure was an exciting event!<br>

            I achieved Gold in the Secondary 3 Badminton Inter-Class Games with my team.<br>
            We started off on a losing end but with constant perseverance and teamwork, we managed to arise victorious as first place in the cohort!<br>

            I also achieved certificates for completing Python and SQL modules too!<br>
            Learning something aligned with my interests during my own free time definitely was fun and enjoyable!<br>
